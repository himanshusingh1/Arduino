TFT_22_ILI9225
==============

This is a library for the ILI9225 TFT display products, forked from the screen_4D_22_library library. Ability to
use GLCD fonts has been added and the syntax has been changed to match the Adafruit libraries somewhat.

This library works with the ILI9225 based 2.2" 176x220 TFT LCD shields commonly found on eBay. Note
that there is a commonly available 2.2" 240x320 TFT module very similar in appearance but using the
ILI9341 driver.
